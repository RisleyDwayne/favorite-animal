        <p>Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals found throughout almost all countries of South America except Chile. They
            live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes, as
            well as flooded savannah and along rivers in the tropical rainforest.</p>
